I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://bnn.upc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barcelona Neural Networking Center</a>, Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC). Some time ago, I decided to start this personal project where I'll be reading research papers (mainly from the field of communication networks) and summarize the key ideas here. This project is totally motivated by personal reasons but I decided to share the summaries as I thought that maybe someone might find them useful. Below you can find the full list of research papers and the links to their respective summaries.  

If you want to know more about my projects, you can find me in Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulAlmasan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@PaulAlmasan</a> or in <a href="https://paulalmasan.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my personal page</a>.
